# CollegeDataAnalysis
Using R, projects analyze data through logistic regression, Ridge, and Lasso regression, and model evaluation. They focus on predicting college types and student success, showcasing R's application in statistical analysis and machine learning.

The series of projects employ various statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze data from distinct domains using R programming. The first project utilizes logistic regression to analyze a college dataset from the ISLR package, aiming to predict whether colleges are private or public based on various features. It involves exploratory data analysis, dataset splitting, logistic regression modeling, and evaluation using confusion matrices and accuracy metrics. The second project explores regularization techniques, specifically Ridge and Lasso regression, applied to the same college dataset. This aims to improve model accuracy by addressing overfitting and identifying significant predictors through the glmnet package. Model performance is assessed using root mean squared error (RMSE) and variable significance.

The third project shifts focus to analyzing student achievement data from Portuguese schools, aiming to predict student success based on demographic, social, and academic variables. It involves data cleaning, correlation analysis, logistic regression modeling with variable selection, and model evaluation through confusion matrices, ROC curves, and AUC scores. Each project progressively addresses more complex data analysis challenges, showcasing the application of logistic regression, regularization techniques, and model evaluation methods. The outputs range from predictive models that classify colleges by type to models predicting student success, demonstrating the versatility of R programming in statistical analysis and machine learning.
